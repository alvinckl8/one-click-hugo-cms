      Vaginal tightening hifu head:

      1.4.5mm heads produce the energy directly to the SMAS , make it thermal coagulation , make the SMAS tighten and lifting, let the muscles improved the muscle structure from deep to shallow, make better to help the muscle layer restor elasticity and tighten.


      2.3.0mm heads produce energy up to submucosal tissue accelerate cell activity and make the collegen regrowth and restructuring, increase mucous elasticity and meke vaginal muscle tighten.




      Face lifting hifu head:

      2. DS-3.0 for transmitting high frequency of 8 MHZ focused ultrasound energy into the dermis layer of the skin tissue,the ultrasound to penetrate the skin to a depth of 3.0mm,is responsible for activating the skin’s dermal layer of collagen,effectively enhance the effect of the consolidation of the outline,but also improve large pores and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
